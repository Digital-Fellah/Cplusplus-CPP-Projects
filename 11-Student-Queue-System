"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program starts by including necessary headers (iostream for input/output operations and queue for using the queue container adapter).
A queue named studentQueue is declared to store student names.
Students are added to the queue using the push method.
The program then displays the current queue status by iterating through the queue using a while loop, printing each student's name with front() and removing them from the queue using pop().
