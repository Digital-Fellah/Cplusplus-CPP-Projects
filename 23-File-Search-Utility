"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

Declare necessary variables for filename, search sequence, and line number.
Prompt the user to input the filename and the sequence they want to search for.
Open the specified file for reading.
Check if the file opened successfully; if not, display an error message and exit.
Read the file line by line.
Use the search algorithm to find the specified sequence within each line of the file.
Output the line number and content whenever the sequence is found.
Close the file after finishing reading.

"""
NOTIONS COVERED

search: Used to find a sequence within a container (in this case, each line of the file).
search_n: Not directly used in this simplified example, but typically used to find multiple occurrences of a sequence in a sequence.
