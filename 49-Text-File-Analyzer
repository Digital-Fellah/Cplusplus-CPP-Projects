EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program starts by prompting the user to enter the filename of the text file they want to analyze.
It opens the specified file and checks if the file opening was successful.
It reads the file line by line using getline() and counts the number of lines.
For each line, it counts the number of characters excluding spaces and updates the total character count.
It uses a stringstream to extract words from each line and counts the number of words.
After processing all lines in the file, it closes the file and prints out the total lines, words, and characters analyzed.
