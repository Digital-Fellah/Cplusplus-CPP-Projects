"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

Sample student grades: Initializes a vector grades with sample integer grades.
Calculate the total number of grades: Uses size() method of vector to determine the number of grades.
Calculate the average grade: Utilizes accumulate() from <numeric> to sum all grades and then divide by the number of grades.
Count the number of failing grades: Uses count_if() from <algorithm> to count how many grades are below 70.
Display results: Outputs the total number of grades, average grade, and number of failing grades to the console.
